# CoG
 Code of Gaming - A lua framework containing support scripts such as oop class creation, shapes, abstract potentiometers, value modifier classes and more.

# Credits
Huge thanks to Bas Groothedde at Imagine Programming for creating the class module. If you'd like to see more of his code, you can visit his GitHub [here](https://github.com/imagine-programming).

#More nfo on usage coming soon.

# Required Modules
While the classes (listed below) are optional to your project, some depend on the scripts listed in this section and, as such, will not function without these being required. 

## Require Order
* class
* const
* math


# The Classes (optional)

## iota
This class is, in effect, a clock/calendar system. It requires the client to update it at the desired intervals but handles all the math and logic of the clock system whenever a change is made to any of the types (seconds, minutes, hours, etc.).

### Planned Features
Add Day Names, Weeks, Months and Days in Each Month 

## point
This is a very simple point class that has no private fields or methods.

#### Fields
* x *A numeric value representing the x value of the point.*
* y *A numeric value representing the y value of the point.*

#### Methods
